		<h2>Beekeeping on Cushing's Island</h2>
		<p>With encouragement, advice and assistance from experienced beekeeper Debby Murray I installed two bee hives on the Island in the spring of 2007. Queen Bee Sarah Meacham has also been very generous, supportive and helpful in this undertaking.</p>

		<p>The hives were originally located at Meacham’s Farm and since 2008 they have been moved to a new bee yard on Farm Hill to be a bit more protected in the winter months, and I have added additional hives - up to seven going into winter 2010. I have started a blog with some of the more colorful experiences with beekeeping on Cushing’s Island.</p>

		<p>If you have any interest in a tour or hive inspection, or helping in any way, please contact me, as I can use the help. They are very gentle and industrious little creatures.</p>

		<p>The Island ecology has noticeably changed since their arrival, with exceptional pollination rates and yields for apples and other fruit trees, so I think the girls are making a significant contribution to the Island flora.</p>

		<p>We have started honey extraction in our kitchen two or three times per summer. I am hoping to get a good honey crop this summer, now that I have an idea what I am doing, and will be planning an Island honey extraction and bottling day likely in early August as a fundraiser for the Cushing Island Conservation Corporation.</p>

		<p>I plan on labeling the honey Farm Hill Apiary, as the main bee yard is on the hill at the present location of Meacham’s Farm, which was originally on the hill leading up to Whitehead before it was moved to its present location in the late 1800’s. My brother John designed the label and I am working on a web site with regular updates on hive inspections and pictures. Sarah thinks I should do some merchandising and sell hats and tee shirts.</p>

		<p>If any of the hives swarms and ends up in your yard I apologize in advance and promise to come collect them.</p>
