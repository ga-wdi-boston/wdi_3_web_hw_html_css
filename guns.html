		<p>That's me having some fun with my friend Ambrose and my Remington 700. We took this shot right before I shot a bottle off clean off the top of his head from 40 feet away. Course I let Ambrose try it on me afterward.  He dclassn't hit the bottle, but he dclassn't hit my head either. That's trust in your friends, your God and your country right there. Amuhhhhhrica. Fuck yeah.</p>

		<p>There she is in a close-up. I tell you what sir, I never fired no gun quite like her. We been together ever since I first cradled her in my arms at the tender age of 14.</p>

		<p>My other baby, the Glock 19 pistol. Sometimes you gotta keep something handy - you know for like around the house if a robber comes and tries to take your shit - a handgun so you can be real quick on the self defense.  I aint never been robbed, probably cause this thing is never more than a few steps away. Ammo for it isn't bad either. Great gun.</p>
