# HTML and CSS Homework

The goal of this homework is to practice basic HTML and CSS before we start using it tomorrow with Sinatra. 

## Assignment

Design and implement a basic site using HTML/CSS and images. Make 6-8 inter-linked pages using the HTML/CSS that we learned today. Be as serious, creative or funny as you'd like to be. 

Make sure you use at least one of each of the following:

* h1 and others
* p
* li
* ul
* dl
* a (links)
* img
* div

Use the [W3C HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to ensure that your code has no errors and few warnings. 

### Bonus

Try using the [Schema.org](http://schema.org) microformat to add additional meaning to the page. 

Try to use [Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts) to make the page all spiffy. 

#### Suggested Themes

* Cats
* Internet Memes
* Your favorite places in Boston/Cambridge
* Halloween Costumes and Activities
* A review of what we've learned about HTML so far
