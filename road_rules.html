  <dt>PEDESTRIANS RULE</dt>
    <dd>Pedestrians always have the right of way. PERIOD.</dd>
  <dt>CROSSWALKS</dt>
    <dd>Leave crosswalks free and clear for safe walking. A bike in the crosswalk can take up as much space as a car. </dd>
  <dt>CLAIM A LANE</dt>
    <dd>Claim space on the street, not the sidewalk. We know we hate it when cars drive in bike lanes.</dd>
  <dt>RIDE RIGHT</dt>
    <dd>Ride in the direction of traffic. When we're on bicycles, we ARE traffic! And it is safer for everyone else on the street.</dd>
  <dt>UNTANGLE INTERSECTIONS</dt>
   <dd>No one can see how good-looking our bikes are if we speed through intersections. And new cyclists will be following our example. Take a break and relax at red lights. </dd>
  <dt>LIGHTEN UP</dt>
    <dd>Don't be invisible. Front and rear lights are our eyes to the world at night and make us bigger and brighter on the street. </dd>
  <dt>SOUND OUT	</dt>
    <dd>Having a bell lets people know we are approaching and it's fun to make some noise! Give your bike bling some ring. </dd>
  <dt>HELMET HEAD RULES	</dt>
    <dd>Bike brains are beautiful, and NYC needs them if we are ever going to convince more people to ride a bike! Learn to love that helmet hair.</dd>
