<p>
	I want to make this website to share a little about myself with my classmates and teachers so they<br>
	can get to know me better. I hope the following pages will give you a little insight into what makes me, me.</p>
<p>
	On the following pages you can find out about some of my interests (well, at least the non-embarrassing ones. You'll notice I haven't included any music because if you ever hear my Pandora stations, you'll see that my musical taste is pretty questionable.)</p>
<p>The things I've included on this page are:<p>
	<ul>
	<li>My cat</li>
	<li>My favorite TV shows</li>
	<li>My college</li>
	<li>My favorite movies</li>
	<li>Things I've eaten a.k.a. food pics - I'm one of <em>those</em> people.</li>
	<li>A few places I've visited.</li>
	</ul>

<dl><p>Do you have questions about me? (Pretty much everyone does.)</p>
<dt>So, where are you from?</dt>
<dd>That's kind of a hard question. I'm from a lot of places, but I grew up mostly in Indiana.</dd>
<dt>Well, that explains what you're doing in Boston.</dt>
<dd>You can say that again. Indiana's not exactly the hub of any kind of universe...Oh wait, the soybean universe...</dd>
<dt>Are you married/single/what-have-you?</dt>
<dd>Married for almost 4 years. This was almost a wedding recap site, but I decided to not be totally vain.</dd>
<dt>What did you do before you decided to get into coding?</dt>
<dd>I was a financial services worker bee. Temping at a job last year that I basically did when I was 21 was a real low point and I decided that something had to change.</dd>
<dt>Well, that was a downer.</dt>
<dd>You did ask.</dd>
<dt>So what are some interesting/cool/fun things you've done? i.e. Got any good stories?</dt>
<dd>Plenty! If you're ever bored, you should ask me about my four trips to Paris, UN internship, Jeopardy! tryout, or wedding magazine article.</dd>
<dt>Brag, much?</dt>
<dd>Hey, you asked!</dd>
