  <h3>Rabbits as Pets</h3>
    <p>Everyone's heard of rabbits; cute, energetic bundles of fun and playfulness. But the house rabbit is a fad that's only just started. It's one of the many ways to care for your rabbit - it will be treated like one of the family. All rabbits have a life expectancy of 5-12 years. They can run around the whole house, and enjoy as much freedom and exercise as a cat or dog. But you have to do it properly, making sure everyone, including the bunny, will be safe, happy and healthy. This article tells you how to do just that. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Care-for-a-House-Rabbit">|for more|</a></p>
