				<h2>LakouMizik.com will serve as a dynamic portal to host the rich media content produced throughout the project and will be an online marketplace for Haitian music. Built as a multimedia musical map, the site will be a window into a rarely seen side of Haiti and a place to discover the vibrant cultural traditions and new rhythms that emanate from dance clubs and taxi&apos;s throughout the country. </h2>
				<p>Through this interactive platform, the Lakou Mizik fan base will be able to connect directly with the artists &amp; organizations that are featured on the site, offering opportunities for both support and collaboration.  LakouMizik.com will also engage the community through outlets such as musical remix competitions and a dedicated space for users to share their own sounds, stories and photos from Haiti.</p>
