<h1>My alma mater</h1>
<div><p>I've always been a school nerd, so when I was looking for a college, I knew I wanted to go to a college where education and learning were the main focus.</p>
<p>I ended up at Bryn Mawr College just outside of Philadelphia. An all-women's college may seem a little antiquated nowadays, but I have to say that the four years I spent there really molded me into the person I am today and I would do it all over again if I could.</p>
