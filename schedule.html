	<h2> Boat Schedule 2013 </h2>
	<p>Ferry service departs Long Wharf in Portland on the passenger ferry St. Croix, and is provided for Island residents and their guests. </p>

	<p>The 2012 boat schedule is now available below.  This information will also be available on the Cushing's Island Calendar.</p>

	<p>Departure times are from Long Wharf off Commercial Street in Portland. Return service from Cushing’s Island is 1/2 hour later.</p>

	<p>All boats call at Summer Landing on Cushing’s Island except the Friday night boat which calls at Government Dock.</p>

	<p>Due to a change in the way the Coast Guard calculates the carrying capacity of ferries, the St. Croix will now be limited to a maximum of 42 passengers per trip. To try to avoid any overcrowding issues, we will be using sign-up sheets more regularly on busy weekends.</p>

	<p>It is also very important that if you have a group of more than eight people planning to ride the ferry to Cushing’s, please let both Harold (Captain Hal) and Danny (our caretaker) know ahead of time. Hopefully these measures will help us avoid anyone not being able to take a boat they had counted on.</p>

	<p>Finally, thank you to everyone who has followed the 35 lb. weight limit on all pieces of freight; please continue to  adhere to that limit and remind your guests and renters that anything over 35 lb. (the equivalent of roughly four gallons of milk) will be the responsibility of the owner to load and unload on the boat and to and from the truck.</p>

	<p>Boat service is provided by Bay Taxi, Inc., who also operate House Island Tours.</p>
