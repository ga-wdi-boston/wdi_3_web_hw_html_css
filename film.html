	<h1>IRONY</h1>
	<p>Neuromancer was the inspiration for a ton of films such as Hackers, the Matrix, Johnny Mnemonic, and Inception. If a film version were released now, it would seem derivative. Still, there are always rumors of a film version in the works. Here are a few of the latest rumors. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Liam Neeson has been offered the role of Armitage and Mark Wahlberg that of Case. PLEASE don't let the latter happen. </li>
		<li>Vincenzo Natali is attached to direct.</li>
